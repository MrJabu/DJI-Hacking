# phantom-firmware-tools communication dissector

Utility for analyzing communication in DJI drone interfaces via [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

## Rationale

This is a [packet dissector](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChapterDissection.html) which allows you
to view and analyze serial communication on interfaces within the DJI drones. It also acts like documentation on
what is known about the DJI protocols, in form of simple LUA code.

## Setup

A simple setup is required to use the new dissector.

### Copy the script files

Copy the files init.lua and dji-p3.lua to the Wireshark profile directory.

#### Copying files in Linux

The directory usually is ```~/.config/wireshark```. If unsure, check [directories chapter in official documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAppFilesConfigurationSection.html).

#### Copying files in Windows

The directory usually is ```C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Wireshark```.  Check [directories chapter in official documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAppFilesConfigurationSection.html)
and a special chapter for Windows folders if unsure.

### Associate comm_serial2pcap output to new dissector

Now we need setup Wireshark to associate the pcap files generated by comm_serial2pcap.py capture script with the dji_p3 protocol dissector. To do this:

* Start Wireshark

* Choose Edit | Preferences | Protocols

* Scroll down to DLT_USER

* Click Edit, create a new entry (‘+’) and set it up as shown below

You may also want to setup Wireshark’s main display columns:

* Choose Edit | Preferences | Columns

* Setup as shown below

## Usage

After setup is complete, you can load pcap files and get results like this:

You can now analyze DJI communication protocols.
