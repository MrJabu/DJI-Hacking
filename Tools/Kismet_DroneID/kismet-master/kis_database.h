/* Kismet Databases
 *
 * Each database is an independent database file, for locking and data integrity
 * simplicity.
 *
 * Each database contains one core table which contains information about
 * the primary module manipulating state, the database version, and the kismet
 * version which last accessed the file.
 *
 * Database versions are monotonically incrementing numbers; a module is
 * expected to detect when the codebase is newer than the database file and
 * perform any upgrades necessary.
 *
 * Providers of database objects must subclass the database and implement an
 * API to abstract the internal SQL commands; callers should not be expected to
 * implement SQL directly.
 *
