/* Fairly basic linked buffer system which allows linear writing and linear reading.
 * Random access is not supported; use a string buffer for that.
 *
 * The linked buffer is best used for buffering serialized output before sending it
 * to the webserver as a stream - minimal copying is needed.
 *
 * Due to some implementation limitations this should probably only be used to stream
 * to a write sink - such as writing to a http endpoint.  Read and peek operations will
 * only return the remaining portion of the current slot as they operate purely on
 * the chunk and prevent memory copying.
