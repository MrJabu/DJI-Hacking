Kismet Rest Examples

- ABOUT THE EXAMPLES -

    These examples show how to talk to Kismet programmatically over the 
    HTTP REST web API.

    Most of the examples use the KismetRest Python library; this library acts
    as a simple interface that uses the Requests library under the covers.

- BUILDING THE LIBRARY -
    
    The Python examples generally use the KismetRest library, which is in 
    this directory.

    To install it, install as you would a normal Python module:
        $ cd KismetRest
        $ python2 ./setup.py build
        $ sudo python2 ./setup.py install
    
    It may be necessary, on some distributions, to install the python setup tools
    package, for example:
        $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    
    As the Kismet API grows this Python code will likely need to change, up until
    the first release when it will be version-matched.  If the example code doesn't
    work, make sure you've updated your KismetRest library by re-running the build
    and install phases.

- ISSUES WITH THE LIBRARY -

    If the example code doesn't work after upgrading the library, there may be
    an old version of the library in the path.  You can try to find it with:

        $ python -v [broken script].py] 2>&1 | grep KismetRest

    which will show where the library is being loaded from.
