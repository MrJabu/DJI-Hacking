Kismet Debug Service

# Purpose

    The Kismet debug service runs Kismet, via systemd, in debug mode.  Logs of full
    thread and backtrace info are stored in /var/log/kismet-debug-[timestamp].log.

# Installing

    You'll need to install two files:

        $ sudo cp kismet_debug /usr/local/bin/
        $ sudo cp kismet-debug.service /etc/systemd/system/

    If you have installed Kismet to a different prefix, such as /usr, you'll need
    to adjust the paths accordingly.  You will need to adjust the path in
    kismet-debug.service as well.

# Activating

    To start Kismet via systemd:

        $ sudo service kismet-debug start

    To start Kismet, with debugging, by default on boot:

        $ sudo systemctl enable kismet-debug
