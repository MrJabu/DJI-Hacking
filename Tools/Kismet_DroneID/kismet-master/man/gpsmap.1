.SH DRAWING METHODS
.SS        TRACK DRAWING
Draws a blue track along the traveled path, based on the track data saved by Kismet.
.SS        BOUNDING RECTANGLE
Draws the bounding rectangle around the extreme points of each network.
.SS        RANGE CIRCLE
Estimates the range of a network based on the average center and the distance 
to the closest extreme corner.
Not exact, but often useful for estimating the  
range of the network.
.SS        CONVEX HULL
Convex hull of all sample points for each network.
This will display the exact 
detected range of the networks.
.SS        SCATTER PLOT
Draws a dot for every detected packet point.
.SS        POWER INTERPOLATION
By far the most CPU intensive, power interpolation forms a grid over the image 
and attempts to interpolate the power for points that aren't directly sampled. 
For this graph to be a reasonable representation of reality, samples around 
the entire area, preferably forming a grid or mesh, should be taken.  
.SS        NETWORK CENTER
Simply draw a dot in the averaged center of each network
.SS        LABELS
Labels are drawn in the order requested in the list.
Labels are drawn based on the center of the network and the label orientation.
There is some logic to attempt to prevent label overlap, but on extremely crowded
maps it will be unavoidable.
.SS        LEGEND
Draws a legend on the bottom of the map with the coordinates, scale, total sampled
networks, networks visible on the current plot, and dynamic information based on the
plots selected and the network color methods requested.
.SH BUGS
While not technically a bug, source 1 (MapPoint) are nonfunctional. 
The vendors have changed their serivice in such a way that it is impossible to download 
the map images from them.  GPSMap still supports these sources, but ONLY for predownloaded 
images that may have been kept previously.  Attempts to use these sources when a user map
is not available will fail.
