This directory includes patches for host systems which Kismet may need
to perform properly (or at all) or to use more advanced features.

linux-tuntapsetlink
-------------------
	This is a simple patch which applies to the Linux 2.6.x kernels and
	provides the ability to set the ARP link type on tun/tap virtual
	interfaces.  Kismet uses this to set the link type of the tapX
	interface to wireless, so that other tools interpret the replicated
	packets properly.
