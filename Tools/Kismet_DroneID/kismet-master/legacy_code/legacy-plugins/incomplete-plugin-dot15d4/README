*** THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY NOT COMPLETE ***

Unless you're in contact with me and are helping develop it, it's not likely
to do what you want.  What it CAN do, currently:

* Drive the AVR RAVEN
* Drive a Linux-Serialdev device via userspace (should work on any platform)
* Read pcap files
* Print debug info about packets
* Log to PCAP file
* Do VERY basic 802.15.4 decoding

1.  What is Kismet-Dot15d4

    Kismet-Dot15d4 is a Kismet plugin which provides 802.15.4 support in
    Kismet.  802.15.4 is a low-power network protocol for sensors, control,
    and other "mote" applications, and is the underpinning of Zigbee, 6pan,
    etc.

    (Some) Driver support is included for the AVR USB RAVEN board, 
    available here:
    http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=ATAVRRZUSBSTICK-ND

    This driver works only under Linux.

    Much more complete (and multiplatform) support is included for devices 
    based on the Linux-Serialdev firmware.  This is a firmware which allows
    an 802.15.4 device to be connected via a serial port.

    Notable devices which support this firmware include the Redbee devices
    (available from http://redwirellc.com/), and devices based on them,
    such as the Quahogcon 2010 conference badge and likely the Ninja
    Networks 2010 Defcon badge.  These devices MUST BE FLASHED to use the
    Linux-Serialdev firmware, firmware and information available at:
    http://mc1322x.devl.org/

    It CAN NOT BE USED with 802.11 wi-fi cards, it is a completely different
    protocol.

    Kismet-Dot15d4 defines the decoders, loggers, and UI controls for
    802.15.4 networks in a common fashion, and supports reading and writing
    IEEE802.15.4 pcap files.

2.  Caveats

    This code is currently only partially developed and may not provide full
    functionality.

    The Raven code implements a user-space driver using Libusb.  Sometimes
    things go stupid and the card or the server fall down during a sync
    problem.

3.  Compiling

	Compiling the Kismet-Dot15d4 plugin requires the Kismet source be installed
	and configured.

	By default, Kismet-Dot15d4 expects the Kismet source to be in
	/usr/src/kismet; this can be overridden by setting the
	KIS_SRC_DIR environment variable:

		cd plugin-dot15d4/
		KIS_SRC_DIR=/home/foo/src/kismet make

    For Raven support, the LibUSB library (and development headers, most
    likely called libusb-devel by your distribution) is required.

4.  Installing

	Kismet plugins may be installed system-wide in the plugins directory (by
	default, /usr/local/lib/kismet/) or in the users home directory
	(~/.kismet/plugins)

    The default installation path can be overridden with the KIS_DEST_DIR
    variable if you have not installed Kismet in the default location and
    wish to install the plugin in the system-wide plugins directory:
        cd plugin-ptw
        KIS_DEST_DIR=/usr make install

    Plugins can be installed in the current users home directory with:
        cd plugin-ptw
        make userinstall

5.  Using

    Once the plugin is loaded, Kismet will automatically understand and
    decode pcap files with the IEEE802.15.4 link data.

    To capture from an AVR RAVEN, plug in the USB device, and define a
    capture source in Kismet using the interface 'raven'.  The device will
    be automatically detected:
        ncsource=raven

    To monitor with multiple Raven devices at once, each raven must have a
    USB device ID specified with the 'usbdev' source option.  The definition
    of the usb device ID depends on the operating system, in Linux it is a
    number incremented for each device and shown in 'lsusb' and 'dmesg'
        ncsource=raven:usbdev=...

    To capture with a Linux-Serialdev device, plug in the usb device, and
    define a capture source for d15d4serial with a device= option pointing
    to the USB serial interface.  For redbee-based devices, this will be the
    SECOND serial device registered:
        ncsource=d15d4serial:device=/dev/ttyUSB1

    To enable pcap logging, the logfile must be turned on by adding
    'pcap15d4' to the logtypes= line of the kismet.conf.
