# Extending Kismet: Creating Tracked Components

Kismet serves complex objects over a REST interface by implementing "tracked components".

Tracked components are introspectable via C++ code and can be dynamically exported to other formats, such as msgpack (which is used heavily in the web interface).

## Deriving from tracker_component
Any data you wish to expose as an object must be derived from tracker_component.

A tracker_component is, internally, a tracked element map, which contains multiple objects, organized as a named dictionary.  This structure typically matches how data presented to the user or to scripts is organized.

Tracker_component objects are derived directly from the base TrackerElement.  A tracker_component may be generated and destroyed for a communication, or used as a permanent storage mechanism.  Kismet typically uses tracker_components to store an object for its entire life cycle when possible.

TrackerElements use C++11 `shared_ptr<>` semantics to manage memory.  For simpler reference, SharedTrackerElement is defined as a `shared_ptr<TrackerElement>`.

### First, the boilerplate:

For our example, we want to mimic the behavior of the Kismet messagebus so that we can display messages on the web UI.

We need to create a message record which has a timestamp, the message content, and a set of flags.

```C++
class WebTrackedMessage : public tracker_component {
public:
    // tracker_component constructor which takes in the global registry 
    // pointer and the id of this element
    WebTrackedMessage(GlobalRegistry *in_globalreg, int in_id) :
        tracker_component(in_globalreg, in_id) {
        // Register and reserve fields will be covered later
        register_fields();
        reserve_fields(NULL);
    }

    // The second common constructor, which takes in the globalreg
    // pointer and id, but also a pointer to a an existing data
    // object.  This is used to construct a custom object from
    // a base which already contains the same fields
    WebTrackedMessage(GlobalRegistry *in_globalreg, int in_id,
            SharedTrackerElement e) :
        tracker_component(in_globalreg, in_id) {
        // Again the register and reserve, but this time we pass the
        // pre-existing element to the reserve_fields object
        register_fields();
        reserve_fields(e);
    }

    // Finally, we need to provide a mechanism for cloning the type
    // of this custom object.  When we add this object to the tracking
    // system which keeps track of named fields, this provides a 
    // factory mechanism which builds a copy when requested.
    virtual shared_ptr<WebTrackedMessage> clone_type() {
        return shared_ptr<WebTrackedMessage>(new WebTrackedMessage(globalreg, get_id()));
    }

}
```

This creates a tracked object, but there is nothing inside of it.  To do that, we need to add some data fields.

### TrackerElement Fields

To track a basic field, we generally only need to track the field itself, so lets add:

```C++
protected:
    SharedTrackerElement timestamp;
    SharedTrackerElement message;
    SharedTrackerElement flags;
```

This gives us three fields, and id values for them.

### Registering Fields

To actually use the fields, they need to be initialized with a type and name.  This is done in the `register_fields()` class method.

```C++
protected:
    virtual void register_fields() {
        // Call the parent register_fields() function
        tracker_component::register_fields();

        // Register the timestamp as a uint64_t
        RegisterField("kismet.message.timestamp", 
                TrackerUInt64, "message timestamp", &timestamp);

        // Register the message as a basic string
        RegisterField("kismet.message.message",
                TrackerString, "message content", &message);

        // Register the flags as an int32_t
        RegisterField("kismet.message.flags",
                TrackerInt32, "message flags", &flags);
    }
```

`RegisterField(...)` is part of the base tracker_component class, and handles the connection between a tracked data set and the tracking system which assigns fields.

It requires a name (which should be unique, you can ensure uniqueness by including a reference to your module in the name), a type (used to manage introspection and export, the list is below), a description (which is shown on the tracked_fields page and is helpful for future developers), and finally a pointer to the `shared_ptr` where your class will hold the data when it is assembled.

RegisterField will return the internal id of the field which is created - most of the time this is not necessary, however when registering more complex instances, such as data held inside a vector, it may be necessary to save the field id.

### Field Primitives

TrackerElements can store most types of data as a primitive:

|Tracker Type|C++ Type|Description|
|---------|--------|-----------|
TrackerString | string | Basic std::string
TrackerInt8 | int8_t | 8bit signed 
TrackerUInt8 | uint8_t | 8bit unsigned
TrackerInt16 | int16_t | 16bit signed
TrackerUInt16 | uint16_t | 16bit unsigned
TrackerInt32 | int32_t | 32bit signed
TrackerUInt32 | uint32_t | 32bit unsigned
TrackerInt64 | int64_t | 64bit signed
TrackerUInt64 | uint64_t | 64bit unsigned
TrackerFloat | float | Floating-point value
TrackerDouble | double | Double-precision floating point value
TrackerMac | mac_addr | Kismet MAC address record
TrackerUuid | uuid | Kismet UUID record
TrackerByteArray | uint8_t* | Arbitrary array of bytes

TrackerElements can also contain more complex data:

|Tracker Type|C++ Equivalent|Description|
|---------|--------|-----------|
TrackerMap | map/dictionary | Element contains additional sub-fields.  All tracker_component objects are Maps internally.
TrackerVector | `vector<SharedTrackerElement>` | Element is a vector of additional elements
TrackerIntMap | `map<int, SharedTrackerElement>` | Element is an integer-indexed map of additional elements.  This is useful for representing a keyed list of data.
TrackerMacMap | `map<mac_addr, SharedTrackerElement>` | Element is a MAC-indexed map of additional elements.  This is useful for representing a keyed list of data such as device relationships.
TrackerStringMap | `map<string, SharedTrackerElement>` | Element is a string-indexed map of additional elements.  This is useful for representing a keyed list of data such as advertised names.
TrackerDoubleMap | `map<double, SharedTrackerElement>` | Element is a double-indexed map of additional elements.

### Accessing the data:  Proxy Functions

Now that we have some data structures, we need to define how to access them.

It's certainly possible to define your own get/set methods, but there are some macros to help you.

The `__Proxy(...)` macro allows easy definition of a handful of methods in one line, at the expense of slightly obtuse syntax:

`__Proxy(name, tracker type, input type, return type, variable)`

This expands to define get and set functions (get_*name* and set_*name*) which accept *input type* variables and return *return type*, while automatically casting it to the type required by the TrackerElement, indicated by *tracker type*.

What this really allows you to define in a single line cast-conversions between compatible types and define standard get/set mechanisms.  For example, for a simple unsigned int element, `flags`, defined as `TrackerUInt32`, you might use:

```C++
public:
    __Proxy(flags, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t, flags);
```

This would expand to define:

```C++
public:
    virtual uint32_t get_flags() const {
        return (uint32_t) GetTrackerValue<uint32_t>(flags);
    }
    virtual void set_flags(uint32_t in) {
        flags->set((uint32_t) in);
    }
```

This looks fairly standard, but allows for more interesting behavior to be defined simply.  For instance, we want to hold a standard unix timestamp (`time_t`) in the timestamp field, however there is no TrackerElement primitive for timestamps.  However, if we do the following:

```C++
public:
    __Proxy(timestamp, uint64_t, time_t, time_t, timestamp);
```

Now we have a get and set pair of functions which accept time_t and transparently cast it to a uint64_t when saving or reading from the TrackerElement variable.  The same trick can be used to make automatic get and set functions for any data type which can be cast directly to the internal tracked type.

Additionally, individual get and set functions can be proxied via `__ProxyGet(...)` and `__ProxySet(...)` if you wish to only expose the get or set, or if you provide a custom get or set function which is more complex.  Numerical values can also define `__ProxyIncDec(...)` or `__ProxyAddSub(...)` to generate increment/decrement (++ and --) and addition/subtraction functions automatically.  Fields which represent a bitset can use `__ProxyBitset(...)` to define bitwise set and clear functions.

There are some other tricks for accessing data which is represented by complex data types, we'll cover them later.

### Building from other data structures

Often you will want to automatically populate a tracked component from an existing data structure.

Due to how trackercomponents are generated, it is not possible to extend the constructors and import data that way, however creating a function for importing data is trivial, especially once the `__Proxy(...)` functions are defined.

To continue our Messagebus example, let's define a method for adapting a message to our tracker_component:

```C++
public:
    void set_from_message(string in_msg, int in_flags) {
        // Since we used __Proxy to define get and set functions, we'll
        // call them instead of doing custom get/set and risking doing
        // it wrong.
        
        set_timestamp(globalreg->timestamp.tv_sec);
        set_message(in_msg);
        set_flags(in_flags);
    }
```

### Using Vector and Map elements

More complex field types - vectors and maps - need special handling.  Typically they do not get manipulated with traditional get/set functions.

#### Using vectors and maps locally

It is possible to use a TrackerElement directly via the complex access APIs, ie `add_vector()`, `add_doublemap()`, etc.  However, it is much simpler to use the wrapper classes which translate the TrackerElements to behave like the STL library versions of their data.

```C++
public:
    void do_something_on_stringmap(string in_key) {
        // Assuming that example_map is a TrackerStringMap, wrap it with
        // a TrackerElementStringMap class
        TrackerElementStringMap smap(example_map);

        if (smap->find(in_key) != smap.end()) {
            // ...
        }

        for (TrackerElementStringMap::iterator i = smap.begin();
                i != smap.end(); ++i) {
            // ...
        }
    }
```

Wrapper classes are provided for all of the TrackerElement variants:

* `TrackerElementVector`
* `TrackerElementMap`
* `TrackerElementIntMap`
* `TrackerElementStringMap`
* `TrackerElementDoubleMap`
* `TrackerElementMacMap`

#### Accessing from outside the object

It may be necessary to allow access from outside callers.  This is only required for other code directly accessing your object; for exporting your data via the REST interface and other serialization methods, so long as your data is in `TrackerElement` objects it will be handled automatically.

If you do need to provide access to your data objects, there are several methods you can utilize:

##### Method one: Provide functions which interface to the complex type

In some instances you may wish to write methods which provide access to the complex type.  For example, assuming that `SharedTrackerElement example_vec` is a TrackerVector, and you wish to add the record `e` to it, it may make sense to implement access thusly:

```C++
public:
    void example_vec_push_back(SharedTrackerElement e) {
        example_vec->add_vector(e);
    }
```

Essentially the same is hiding the internal data structure via your object API:  `add_foo(...)` may internally add to the vector, without ever explicitly exposing the actual data types.

##### Method two: Proxy the TrackedElement directly

By directly returning a pointer to the TrackedElement you can allow consumers to wrap the complex data themselves.  A proxy macro similar to the others is provided:

```C++
public:
    __ProxyTrackable(example_vec, TrackedElement, example_vec);
```

`__ProxyTrackable(...)` takes a name, and the type of shared pointer to return.  This can be used to automatically cast custom data objects to the proper type on access, here, we use TrackedElement and don't change anything.  Finally, it takes the variable.

A caller could use this via:

```C++
    ...
    TrackedElementVector ev(foo->get_example_vec);
    for (TrackedElementVector::iterator i = foo->begin; 
            i != foo->end(); ++i) {
        ...
    }
    ...
```

##### Method three: Provide wrapper objects and expose them

It may make sense to expose the wrapper objects (`TrackerElementVector` and friends):

```C+++
public:
    shared_ptr<TrackerElementVector> get_foo_vec() {
        return foovec_wrapper;
    }

protected:
    SharedTrackerElement foovec;
    shared_ptr<TrackerElementVector> foovec_wrapper;
```

Then there is the question of how to assign the wrapper during the creation.  To do this, we need to override the `reserve_fields(...)` function.  This function is responsible for allocating fields defined in `register_fields()`, and in complex classes, is used to map complex sub-types.

We can ignore the more complex issues, for now, and just use it to build our wrapper.

```C++
private:
    virtual void reserve_fields(SharedTrackerElement e) {
        tracker_component::reserve_fields(e);

        foovec_wrapper.reset(new TrackerElementVec(foovec));
    }
```

Thanks to the C++11 `shared_ptr<>`, the memory used by the wrapper is automatically released when our class is destroyed.

#### Restoring stored maps and vectors

Stored maps and vectors need special care, if they contain complex tracked elements.

As part of the `reserve_fields(...)` function, any vectors, maps, intmaps, stringmaps, doublemaps, or related structures which contain a complex element must rebuild the list as the proper type.

For example, given a vector element defined as:

```c++
void SomeFoo::register_fields() {
...
    // Define a tracked vector
    RegisterField("foo.example.foo_vec", TrackerVector, "example vector", &foo_vec);
    
    // Get the ID for the complex object that will be contained in foo_vec; 'foo_complex'
    // is a trackercomponent we defined elsewhere
    // We use the RegisterComplex with an inline builder object.
    foo_vec_entry_id = RegisterComplexField("foo.example.foo_vec_entry", std::shared_ptr<foo_complex>(new foo_complex(globalreg, 0)), "foo entry");
    ...
}
```
Then the `reserve_fields(...)` function must include:

```c++
void SomeFoo::reserve_fields(SharedTrackerElement e) {
    tracker_component::reserve_fields(e);

    ...

    if (e != NULL) {
        // Use a TrackerElementVector alias to make it simpler
        TrackerElementVector v(foo_vec);

        // Currently the vector contains the generic versions of any data that
        // was loaded from storage; we need to convert them to our complex
        // type; foo_complex
        for (auto i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i) {
            // Generate a foo_complex object, we need to pass it the entry id, and the
            // generic object in the vector; if it was a map, we'd pass it i->second
            std::shared_ptr<foo_complex> nc(new foo_complex(globalreg, foo_vec_entry_id, *i));

            // Replace the existing object in the tree with the complex object we
            // just created; we simply replace the content of the iterator.  If 
            // this were a map, we'd replace i->second.
            *i = nc;
        }

    }

    ...
```

This needs to be done for any vectors or maps which contain complex types.

## Including complex sub-components

Being able to nest complex objects inside a `tracker_component` is one of the major advantages it offers, and code and data-type re-use is encouraged whenever possible.

Lets say we want to add a location to our data type.  A location block is already defined in `devicetracker_component.h`.

### First, add the location elements

Unlike many other `TrackerElement` / `tracker_component` derived item, we need the ID and the element to track it.  In this case, we'll use the actual C++ class, remembering to include `devicetracker_component.h`.  Remember to use shared_ptr to define these complex variables:

```C++
private:
    int location_id;
    shared_ptr<kis_tracked_location> location;
```

### Registering complex elements

To register an element derived from a complex class like `kis_tracked_location`, we need to provide an instance of the C++ class.  Later, the entry tracker code will use this class to call `clone_type()` and generate a new instance for us.  

To do this, our `register_fields()` function looks like this now:

```C++
private:
    virtual void register_fields() {
        ... Existing field registration

        // We instantiate a builder, passing in globalreg, and an id of 0.  The
        // entry tracker will fill in the correct ID later.  We defined the builder
        // as a shared_ptr
        shared_ptr<kis_tracked_location> loc_builder(new kis_tracked_location(globalreg, 0));

        // Register the field as complex type, providing our builder.  We still
        // give it a name based on our class, and a description
        location_id =
            RegisterComplexField("foo.location", loc_builder, "location");
    }
```

Alternately, the `__RegisterComplexField` macro can be used to simplify the process:

```C++
private:
    virtual void register_fields() {
        ... Existing field registration

        // Register using the __RegisterComplexField macro, which takes the class
        // of the complex object, the id, the field name, and the description
        __RegisterComplexField(kis_tracked_location, location_id,
            "foo.location", "location");
    }
```

### Allocating the complex element

Also, special care needs to be taken for actually allocating the complex element.  As we learned above, allocating fields is done in the `reserve_fields(...)` function.

The `reserve_fields(...)` method is used to both allocate new instances of fields, or to attach fields to an existing TrackerElement (for instance, once received from a generic deserialization of incoming data).  

For our complex element, we simply need to instantiate it using the incoming data:

```C++
private:
    virtual void reserve_fields(SharedTrackerElement e) {
        // We MUST call the parent instance
        tracker_component::reserve_fields(e);

        // The parent takes care of anything that uses TrackerElement, we only
        // have to worry about the custom fields

        if (e != NULL) {
            // If we're absorbing an existing generic structure, all we
            // need to do is instantiate a new object of the right ID.
            // It's already part of the map for the base object.
          
            // So we pass globalreg, the id we got from registering,
            // and then we search in our object for the sub-tree of data
            // matching our ID, which was built for us during deserializaton
            // Since all elements are shared_ptr constructs, we use the 
            // .reset function to re-assign to our new object
            location.reset(new kis_tracked_location(globalreg, location_id,
                    e->get_map_value(location_id)));
        } else {
            // Otherwise, we're making a whole new object.  This is usually the
            // case.

            // So make a new location object, and assign it using reset
            location.reset(new kis_tracked_location(globalreg, location_id));
        }

        // And then attach it to our map so that it's tracked correctly
        add_map(location);
    }
```

### Dynamic complex elements

Complex elements typically hold many sub-fields - for example a RRD can hold over a hundred samples, and some records, like signal or location, can rapidly grow in size.

If possible, these elements should be allocated dynamically, instead of inserted in every object.  Kismet provides a mechanism to do this simply via `__ProxyDynamicTrackable(...)` which defines functions to automatically create the complex record at the first `get` request - this allows you to keep the rest of your code simple.

To use the dynamic method of defining a complex object, first change your `__ProxyTrackable` to `__ProxyDynamicTrackable`.  This takes an additional argument:  the ID of the complex to create:

```C++
__ProxyDynamicTrackable(location, kis_tracked_location, location, location_id);
```

This defines a get_location(...) function which will automatically create a kis_tracked_location if we don't have one.

Next, we modify our reserve_fields function:

```C++
private:
    virtual void reserve_fields(SharedTrackerElement e) {
        // We MUST call the parent instance
        tracker_component::reserve_fields(e);

        // The parent takes care of anything that uses TrackerElement, we only
        // have to worry about the custom fields

        if (e != NULL) {
            if (e->get_map_value(location_id) != NULL) {
                location.reset(new kis_tracked_location(globalreg, location_id,
                    e->get_map_value(location_id)));
            }
        } 


        add_map(location_id, location);
    }
```

Notice two important changes:

1. We only allocate the `location` record if we are inheriting an object which defines it.  We do NOT create an empty `location` if the object we're absorbing into our record does not have it, or if we're creating an entirely new class, we leave the `shared_ptr` set to NULL.
2. We *must* provide the field id in the `add_map` call now.  `add_map(SharedElement *)` extracts the id from the element automatically - but our element may be NULL!  By providing the ID we place the element in the map as a placeholder with a NULL value.  When we create it dynamically later, it will be filled in in-place.

With these two changes, all the memory used by the `kis_tracked_location` complex will only be allocated once a location has been obtained, so long as all accesses to it are handled via `whatever->get_location()->...`.

Empty objects will be serialized as a uint8 zero value:

```json
"kismet_device_base_packet_bin_250": 0,
"kismet_device_base_packet_bin_500": 0,
```

### Providing access

Providing access to the child custom type is much the same as providing access to complex `TrackerElement` types, either by providing custom APIs or providing direct access via `__ProxyTrackable(...)`.

## Serialization

Serialization is handled by the `tracker_component` and `TrackerElement` system automatically.  Since the types of the fields are introspectable, serialization systems should be able to export nested data automatically.  

The only aspect of serialization that a custom `tracker_component` class needs to consider is what happens prior to serialization.  This is handled by the `pre_serialize()` method, and is called by any serialization/export class.

This method allows the class to do any updating, averaging, etc before its contents are delivered to a REST endpoing, XML serialization, or other export.

For example, the RRD object uses this method to ensure that the data is synced to the current time:

```C++
public:
    virtual void pre_serialize() {
        // Always call the parent in case work needs to be done
        tracker_component::pre_serialize();

        // Call an internal funtion for adding a sample; we add '0' to our
        // current sample and set the time, this fast-forwards the RRD to
        // 'now' and computes history for us in case we didn't see an update
        // in a long time
        add_sample(0, globalreg->timestamp.tv_sec);
    }
```

### Using `tracker_component` objects elsewhere

Sometimes you will want to use a `tracker_component` in a class that is not, itself, a component: creating data for serialization is a good example.

`tracker_component` objects can be created and used as normal, with one important exception: The internal object management system expects them to be managed via `shared_ptr<>`.  Failure to pass the proper owning shared_ptr record can result in memory being freed prematurely.

One uncommon condition happens when implementing high-level global constructs which are, themselves, trackable elements:  for example, the `system_monitor` class provides its data by directly serializing itself.  This must be accounted for by creating a `create_xyz(...)` method and assigning the initial `shared_ptr<>` reference to a `GlobalRegistry` variable.

A more common condition is when creating temporary records for exporting, for instance, a temporary list of devices.  In these cases, the `shared_ptr<>` reference can be held by the calling function until the task is complete:

```C++

int foo::bar() {
    shared_ptr<some_component> c(new some_component(globalreg, some_component_id));

    // Do stuff, 'c' is automatically freed when all references expire.
    // This can include passing it to a serializer, embedding it in an object
    // via add_map or similar, etc.

}
```

It is important to remember that due to the mechanics of `shared_ptr<>` that two shared pointers created referencing the same object *are not identical*.  There must be *one, single, canonical shared_ptr which defines an object*, and all other references must be copied from that pointer.  Attempting to cast an existing object to a `shared_ptr<>` or creating a `shared_ptr<>` from a `this` pointer will result in multiple usage counts to the same memory and premature freeing of the object.
