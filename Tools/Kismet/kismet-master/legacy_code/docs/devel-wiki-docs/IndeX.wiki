= Kismet Development Wiki =

== What you'll find ==

This wiki is for holding information about writing plugins and other ways to 
interact with the Kismet source.

== About the Wiki ==

This Wiki was created using Wicked, the VIM wiki plugin.  It can be exported
to other formats using the Wicked tools (which don't require VIM) available at
http://www.redsheep.de/wiked/ .  

== Core code components ==

Kismet is divided into multiple, mostly self-contained subsystems.  To hook 
into the inner workings, you must register components with each.
