=AlertTracker=

AlertTracker is responsible for defining IDS alerts, throttling alert rates 
based on configuration, and other alert duties.

Alerts are created with:
	int RegisterAlert(const char *in_header, alert_time_unit in_unit, int 
					  in_rate, int in_burst);

	The returned integer is the reference value for the created alert or (-1) 
	for failure.  This reference value is needed for other alert funtions.
	
	``in_header'' is the name of the alert sent in the *ALERT protocol.

	Rate limiting should be read from the ConfigFile.

Alerts are raised with:
	int RaiseAlert(int in_ref, mac_addr bssid, mac_addr source, mac_addr dest, 
				   mac_addr other, int in_channel, string in_text);

If generating a given alert is a time consuming task, a quick test can be 
performed to see if the alert would be sent:
	int PotentialAlert(int in_ref);
