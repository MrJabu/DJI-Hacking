1.  What is Kismet-BTSCAN

    Kismet-BTSCAN is a Kismet plugin which provides basic scan support for
    Bluetooth, aka 802.15.1.  Bluetooth is a (relatively) low-power PAN
    network protocol for streaming audio, sharing phone data, etc.

    This is NOT a Bluetooth SNIFFER.  Kismet-BTSCAN uses the scan
    functionality in the bluetooth drivers to find nearby DISCOVERABLE
    bluetooth devices.

    It CAN NOT BE USED with 802.11 wi-fi cards, it is a completely different
    protocol.

2.  Caveats

    This code is currently under development and does not yet provide the
    full anticipated functionality, however it can display nearby
    discoverable bluetooth devices.

    This is NOT A BLUETOOTH SNIFFER.  It will NOT find undiscoverable
    devices.  Kismet-BTSCAN uses the built-in scan functionality of the
    bluetooth devices to query nearby discoverable devices.

    This CAN NOT capture bluetooth audio streams.  It is a scanner only.

    Currently, Kismet-BTSCAN works only on Linux, however the framework is
    in place to allow working on other platforms in the future.

    Kismet-BTSCAN uses ACTIVE SCANNING in your device.  This means PACKETS
    WILL BE SENT.  If this is not acceptable, do NOT use Kismet-BTSCAN.

3.  Compiling

	Compiling the Kismet-BTSCAN plugin requires the Kismet source be installed
	and configured.

	By default, Kismet-BTSCAN expects the Kismet source to be in
	/usr/src/kismet; this can be overridden by setting the
	KIS_SRC_DIR environment variable:

		cd plugin-btscan/
		KIS_SRC_DIR=/home/foo/src/kismet make

4.  Installing

	Kismet plugins may be installed system-wide in the plugins directory (by
	default, /usr/local/lib/kismet/) or in the users home directory
	(~/.kismet/plugins)

    The default installation path can be overridden with the KIS_DEST_DIR
    variable if you have not installed Kismet in the default location and
    wish to install the plugin in the system-wide plugins directory:
        cd plugin-ptw
        KIS_DEST_DIR=/usr make install

    Plugins can be installed in the current users home directory with:
        cd plugin-ptw
        make userinstall

5.  Using

    Once the plugin is loaded, Kismet will automatically understand capture
    interfaces which are Linux bluetooth devices. 

    The UI is currently very simplistic, but will be expanded on in the
    future.

    To enable scanning on a bluetooth interface, define a capture source
    in Kismet using that interface (such as 'hci0').  The device will be
    automatically detected as type 'btscan'.

    Kismet-BTSCAN cannot log to a pcap file, as individual packets are not
    captured.  It can however log to a text file, enable 'btscantxt' in your
    logtypes= line in kismet.conf
