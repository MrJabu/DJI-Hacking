.SH DESCRIPTION
kismet_drone uses a minimalized configuration file, similar in options to the
main kismet server configuration file.  By default, the drone config is in
/usr/local/etc/kismet.conf.  A default configuration is included with Kismet but
it is likely you will need to modify it to suit your hardware and preferences.
