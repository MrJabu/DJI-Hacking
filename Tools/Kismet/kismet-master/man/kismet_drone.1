.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkismet_drone\fP supports all the capture sources available to Kismet.  Instead of 
processing packets locally, kismet_drone makes them available via TCP to a remote kismet_server
using the 'drone' capture source.
.SH USAGE
\fBkismet_drone\fP should be configured as you would \fBkismet_server\fP.  All logging,
packet dissection, etc will take place on the remote kismet server using the 'drone' 
capture source.
.PP
\fBkismet_monitor\fP should be used to place capture sources into rfmonitor mode as 
needed, and \fBkismet_hopper\fP should be used for channel hopping.
.PP
\fBkismet_drone\fP is controlled by the \fBkismet_drone.conf\fP config file.
.SH ENCRYPTION
It may be desireable to encrypt the packet stream between the remote drone and the 
kismet system.  Standard SSH packet tunneling or any other tunneling/forwarding system
may be used, and is recommended.
