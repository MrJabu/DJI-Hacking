This file adds additional channels within the 2.4 ghz band increasing them to 32.

Depending on the GO App, by selecting “manual channel selection” one of the additional channels can be set.

This can be useful in certain circumstances for example when flying multiple dji craft in the same proximity.

Or in a dense interference area. Currently, the 32 Ch. mod cannot be combined with the FCC mods.

This increases the Downlink from 8 channels to 32 channels

When on AUTO the device will still select from the original 8 channels only

Switch to CUSTOM to select from all 32 channels.

32 channel mod WITH FCC mod is experimental.
